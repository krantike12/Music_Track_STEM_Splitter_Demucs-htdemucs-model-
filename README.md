# 🎶 Music Track STEM Splitter using Demucs (htdemucs-model)

A locally-run, high-fidelity music stem splitter built with [Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs)'s `htdemucs` model. This project empowers musicians, producers, and creators to extract **vocals**, **drums**, **bass**, and **other instruments** from full tracks—without relying on expensive APIs or cloud services.

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Most stem separation tools today are locked behind paywalls, throttled APIs, or limited free tiers. As a musician, I wanted to build something **free**, **local**, and **artist-friendly**—a tool that respects creativity and doesn’t gatekeep access to essential production workflows.

This project is my contribution to the music community:  
- 🎧 No request limits  
- 💸 No pricing tiers  
- 🖥️ Runs entirely on your machine  
- 🎛️ Built for remixing, karaoke, sampling, and education
